#Week 1: Git & GitHub Basics

## 1. What I Built
- I created my first repository on GitHub and added the initial files.
- Updated the README.md with my name and a short description.
-Made my first commit and pushed the changes.
Opened Issue #1 and closed it autonatically by referencing it in a commit message.
Created fun-fact, added a new section in the README.

## 2. My Exploration
**Link to Evidence
[Issue#1](../issues/1)
[Pull Request for fun-fact branch](../pull/1)

## 3. Use of GenAI
**What I Asked It To Do**
I asked for help when I got stuck uninstalling and reinstalling Anaconda on my Mac, and when trying to connect it with VS Code.
**What I Got and Did With It**
The AI suggested the following cleanup commands before reinstalling.
-sudo rm -rf /opt/anaconda3
rm -rf ~/.conda ~/.continuum ~/.anaconda_backup
After following these steps, I was able to reinstall Anaconda successfully and continue with the setup.

## 4. Reflection
This was my first proper week working with Git and GitHub. At first, staging vs. committing was confusing, but after some practice it became clearer.  

The branching and pull request exercise was very helpful for me to see why teams don’t work directly on `main`. It gave me a better idea of how collaboration works in real projects.  

The most difficult part was actually not Git itself, but setting up Anaconda and VS Code together. I got stuck uninstalling the old Anaconda version, but with the AI’s guidance I solved it.  

Overall, I feel much more confident now.
